        <p>A wire basket filled with marine life in Red Hook is about to get more action than it has in years thanks to a few emails, a Facebook post and an enthusiastic community committed to connecting with the Red Hook waterfront. </p>

        <p>The basket hangs from the Mary A. Whalen, an 83-year-old tanker boat and home to waterfront advocacy group PortSide New York. It is one of Billion Oyster Project’s Oyster Research Stations, designed to be pulled out of the water and inspected by citizen scientists, who measure the oysters and look for other critters, then report the data to Billion Oyster Project. </p>

        <p>One of about 200 Oyster Research Stations dotting the edges of New York’s waterways, the PortSide basket has languished for about five years since it was installed, with school groups and community members visiting infrequently. </p>

        <p>That pattern is changing. In late September, thinking that the basket faced threat of removal, PortSide Executive Director Carolina Salguero put out a plea for engagement to Red Hook schools and the wider community. </p>

        <p>“Want to learn about oysters? And help restore them in NY Harbor?” Read Salguero’s Sept. 28 post to PortSide’s bustling Facebook page. “Then please have your school, class, student volunteer project, or your adult self get involved in using PortSide’s Billion Oyster Project (BOP) basket. We are reaching out because our basket has not [been] seeing enough use.” </p>

        <p>Salguero received what she called a “stampede” in response, with more than a dozen interested people replying within just a few days. </p>

        <p>At least two Red Hook public schools that were not previously engaged with the research station are now pursuing field trips to the Whalen. Increasing waterfront access for students is crucial, says Billion Oyster Project Outreach and Engagement Manager Agata Poniatowski. </p>

        <p>“Restricting access to lower-income neighborhoods and lower-income schools to the waterfront is a big problem,” she said. </p>

        <p>The Department of Education agrees. Last spring, the agency’s Panel for Educational Policy approved a proposal to transition Red Hook’s PS 676 from an elementary school to a maritime-themed middle school. The change would give students the chance to engage more with their coastal neighborhood and open them to opportunities in maritime or marine careers, said Billion Oyster Project Communications Director Helene Hetrick. </p>

        <p>Billion Oyster Project aims to restore 1 billion oysters to New York’s waterways by 2035 and engage 1 million New Yorkers in the process. “We really don’t have too many ways that people can access our blue spaces,” said Poniatowski. “And we’re a coastal city. We’ve got water all around us. People forget that they’re on an island sometimes.” </p>

        <p>Oysters play a significant role in New York’s history. Before industrialization, an estimated 220,000 acres of oysters lived in the city’s waterways. The population was largely eradicated within 100 years as the city grew. </p>

        <p>“If you think of Jenga, imagine just pulling out the bottom blocks that are balancing the whole tower. It can stand, but it’s wobbly and it’s not stable. Oysters help provide stability,” said Poniatowski. </p>

        <p>Oyster clusters create habitats for other organisms, improving biodiversity. They also help clean New York’s waterways: one adult oyster can filter 30 to 50 gallons of water a day. One billion oysters would be able to filter all the standing water in the harbor every three days. </p>

        <p>But simply restoring the oysters is not enough, Poniatowski says. “You need restoration with education, education with restoration. They need to be paired,” she said. </p>

        <p>Salguero’s call to action ignited enthusiasm among a community primed to explore and care for its natural resources. </p>

        <p>Carroll Gardens resident Jennifer Diamond, 51, says she did not know about the basket before she read about it on Facebook. Now, she looks forward to bringing her 12-year-old daughter and her friends to volunteer with her at PortSide. “It’s something that they could put their hands on and make a change,” she said. </p>
